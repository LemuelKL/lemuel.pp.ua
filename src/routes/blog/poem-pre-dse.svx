summary: A poem I rediscovered recently about my stress while preparing for DSE
---

I wrote this during a class for my DSE Chinese writing paper. We were not supposed to write poems, and told to just 

I was stressed out and I wrote this poem to vent out my feelings.

Original text in Traditional Chinese:

深秋的睡意從窗縫飄入，像要撲熄雄雄鬥志。腦筋發麻，雙目對著白紙中的幾層影發呆。

母親望過時鐘，心不在焉，一面無力，在桌邊刨刨那些不屬於她的鉛筆，游說早點睡覺，提醒小心著涼。步入睡房前，還是不忍，回首，替我整理衣襟：「臨，不用給自己太大壓力的。」滿臉倦容的我只好輕輕點頭示意，連仰面投以眼色的力氣也沒有。

無雲的秋空下，透涼的空氣伴著大地的味道，吹透每個角落。

秋葉離開了母親，自由地飄逸著，被一戶柔黄檯燈吸引著，落到城市中一個挑燈夜讀的小孩面前。小孩對於自由的渴望，使他羨慕這塊黃葉，但他無暇多想，還是要繼續執筆寫字。小孩對燈獨坐，承受不了秋風的肅寂，只好向天上嫦娥訴苦。

English translation in English by ChatGPT:

The drowsiness of late autumn drifts in through the window cracks,
As if to extinguish the fighting spirit of the proud and strong.
My mind goes numb, my eyes staring blankly at the layers of shadows on the blank paper.

My mother looks at the clock absentmindedly, feeling powerless,
Fiddling with the pencils on the desk that don't belong to her,
Urging me to sleep early and reminding me to be careful of catching a cold.
Before entering the bedroom, she can't bear it and turns around,
Adjusting my collar for me and saying, "Don't put too much pressure on yourself."
With a tired expression, I can only nod slightly, without even the strength to look up at her.

Under the clear autumn sky, the cool air is accompanied by the scent of the earth,
Blowing through every corner.

The autumn leaves leave my mother and float freely,
Attracted by a soft yellow table lamp and landing in front of a child who is studying by lamplight in the city.
The child longs for freedom and envies this yellow leaf, but has no time to think about it,
And must continue to hold the pen and write.
The child cannot bear the solemnity of the autumn breeze while sitting alone under the lamplight,
So he complains to the moon goddess in the sky.
