	<p class="text-2xl italic">Introduction</p>
	<p>
		My name is Lee Kwok Lam. Please just call me Lemuel. I was born and raised in Hong Kong. I
		am pursuing a BEng(CompSc) from The University of Hong Kong. But right now, I am in the UK,
		being an exchange student at Royal Holloway, University of London.
	</p>

	<p class="text-2xl italic">Philosophy</p>
	<p>
		I believe the fundamental narrative of life is suffering. I have accepted the terrible
		repsonsibility conciousness implies, and have decided to carry this burden and face the
		neccessary challenges with my shoulders back.
	</p>

	<p class="text-2xl italic">Personality</p>
	<p>
		I try be honest with people. I tend to approach discussions directly and see them as the way
		to resolving problems in life. Of course I am not naive and expect people in return. I am
		capable of great destruction when neccessary.
	</p>
	<p>
		I employ self-improvement as the great strategy for life. I actively plan out my days and
		weeks. I invest a lot of time fiddling with various scheduling and project management
		software so that my life is efficient.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tend to and is very good at working alone. I am not a fan of group work, but I think this
		is because I have yet to be in a group of capable people since I am still in school.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some say I'm too analytical. I tend to start offering solutions and laying out possible
		consequences of actions when talking with people. This often makes people feel
		uncomfortable. I think this is because in life, when one traces back to the root of a
		problem, one will discover it is the result of some decisions one made in the past.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the MBTI 16 Personalities Test, I am an INTJ. A teacher of mine introduced me this test
		in 2019. I have since been doing it occasionally the results remain unchanged.
	</p>

	<p class="place-self-start text-2xl italic">Hobbies</p>
	<p>
		I used to have more hobbies when I was small. I drew many 2D diagrams of military bases,
		tanks, and guns in great details.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got addicated in Minecraft when it was 1.4.7. I started building structures with
		automations. I have built many variants of redstone elevators, some IOT light switches for
		my home (in Minecraft), animal farms, and many more.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now I have devloped a love for cycling. I have always liked the feeling of it, gives me
		great sense of autonomy. Seeing a fit person is riding a sleek bike with ideal posture is
		such majestic sight.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also like to read which I did A LOT when I was small. My taste hasn't changed much. I
		still highly prefer genres like User Manual, Dictionary, Documentary, Historical Archive,
		and such. As I mature, I have started to add in some religious and philisophical texts to my
		list.
	</p>

	<p class="place-self-start text-2xl italic">Taste</p>
	<p>
		I believe good men have good taste. You wouldn't want to make friends with people who have
		"bad faith" (as in Existentialism) or nihilistic view on life.
	</p>
	<p>
		I dress simply and modestly. When I go to lectures, I wear a shirt and pants. At the very
		least, something with a collar. Dressing like a slob or a slut is a sign of disrespect to
		oneself and others. Fashion is an interesting way of knowing one's values system.
	</p>
	<p>
		I almost exclusively listen to classical musics. I listen to fit the moment. Flute when
		creativity is required. Piano for a calm and clear state of mind. Violin for emotional
		unentanglement. I love vocals, especially pieces that are sung during important ceremonies.
		They remind me of humanities and the fundamental assumptions and following of the good
		values in life (like Love and Hope) despite the tragic of reality.
