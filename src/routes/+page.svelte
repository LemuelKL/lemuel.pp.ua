		<p>
			I was born and raised in Hong Kong. I am pursuing a BEng(CompSc) from The University of Hong
			Kong. Right now, I am in the UK, being an exchange student at Royal Holloway, University of
			London.
		</p>

		<p class="place-self-start text-2xl italic">Philosophy</p>
		<p>
			I believe the fundamental narrative of life is suffering. I have accepted the terrible
			repsonsibility conciousness implies, and have decided to carry on this burden and face the
			neccessary challenges with my shoulders back.
		</p>

		<p class="place-self-start text-2xl italic">Personality</p>
		<p>
			I try be honest with people. I speak directly and see discussion as the way to resolving
			problems in life. Of course I am not naive and expect people in return. I am capable of great
			destruction when neccessary.
		</p>
		<p>
			I seek out to improve myself daily and make steps towards a list of goals I forsee for the
			coming years. I tend to and is very good at working alone. I am not a fan of group work, but I
			think this is because I have yet to be in a group of capable people since I am still in
			school.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some say I'm too analytical. When told about small things in life, I immediately start
			offering possible solutions and calculating their respective risks and return. This sometimes
			makes people rather uncomfortable because when you unpack problems in life, you can often
			trace them back to your past actions.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the MBTI 16 Personalities Test, I am an INTJ. I first came across this test in 2019 from a
			teacher. I have since been doing it once a year and the results remain unchanged.
		</p>

		<p class="place-self-start text-2xl italic">Hobbies</p>
		<p>
			I used to have more hobbies when I was small. I drew many 2D diagrams of military bases,
			tanks, and guns in great details.
		</p>
		<p>
			I got addicated in Minecraft when it was 1.4.7. I started building structures with
			automations. I have built many variants of redstone elevators, some IOT light switches for my
			home (in Minecraft), animal farms, and many more.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now I have devloped a love for cycling. I have always liked the feeling of cycling. It gives
			me great sense of control and autonomy. When a fit person is riding a sleek bike with ideal
			posture, it is a very majestic sight.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also like to read. I used to read A LOT when I was small. My taste hasn't changed much. I
			still highly prefer genres like User Manual, Dictionary, Documentary, Historical Archive, and
			such. As I mature, I have started to add in some religious and philisophical texts to my list.
